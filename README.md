# Discord React Bot

## Prerequisites
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/) is needed to run the script.

[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is the only additional module that is 
used in the script. If you have Selenium installed you can skip the setting 
up step.

## Setting up

### Installing the modules
Open the Windows Command Prompt and type in:
```python
cd "path/to/a/script/folder"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Adding the required emojis to favourites
To insure that the script is running correctly you need to add all the 
emojis you want to put to favourites in discord. To do that right click 
the emoji and click "add to favourites".

## Running the software
After the set up is done, type in:
```python
python main.py
```
